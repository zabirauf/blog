I [got my glider rating](/blog/aviation/glider_addon_rating) in October 2021 and in 2022 my goal is to learn more about soaring and get better at it. I recently started flying more at my local soaring club and as I get checked out in gliders I want to use glide computer for both navigation and starting some cross country (XC) soaring.

[XCSoar](https://xcsoar.org/) is a well known and Open Source glider computer. It is supported on multiple platforms but iOS is not one of them. Along with being supported on Android, its also supported on certain Kobo e-ink readers. The advantage of Kobo is that, it has better battery, works well in direct sunlight. The cons are that it's doesn't have colored screen and will be slower than an Android tablet or phone. Another aspect is that is that as Kobo itself doesn't have GPS, Baro etc. (standard on Android devices) so I would need to have another device that feeds all that info into Kobo.

[Blyefly Vario](https://www.blueflyvario.com/product/blueflyvario_ttl_gps_v12-2/) is a device I found which provides the GPS, Pressure sensor, Variometer and a small speaker. Connecting this with Kobo will make the whole thing a self contained device that you can easily take from one club ship to another.
